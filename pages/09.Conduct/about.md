# Code of Conduct

NDLC '16 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender
 identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, receptions, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.
Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, 
age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion (or lack thereof)
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

If you are being harassed or notice that someone else is being harassed, if someone makes you or anyone else feel 
unsafe or unwelcome, or if you have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff as soon as possible. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.
All conference participants, speakers, presenters, and vendors are subject to this code of conduct. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expelling the offender from the conference with no refund.
