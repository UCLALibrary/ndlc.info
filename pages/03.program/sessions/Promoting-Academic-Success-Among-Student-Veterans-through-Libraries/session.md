_Librarians from USC will report a survey of academic libraries on current services and resources offered to student veterans, as well as to assess student veterans’ information needs and identify challenges and barriers of working with them. One example took place at L.A. Pierce College, where the library presented programming related to the veteran experience tied in to the college’s One Book-One Campus program. This resulted in greater outreach to the campus veteran community through student curriculum and campus events._
