_The UIC Dialogue Initiative runs courses and co-curriculars for students, faculty, and staff at UIC centered around 
understanding identity, power/privilege, and bias. This hands-on workshop will give participants a chance to 
experience dialogue and engage in some of the activities we do in the classroom. Our activities will focus on your social identities and how they carry over to your work as a librarian. _
