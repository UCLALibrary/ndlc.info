_This session will discuss the challenges and opportunities for libraries and archives to provide services and meet the information needs of community members with disabilities. Experiences working with college students on the autism spectrum, a collaborative volunteer project for survivors of Traumatic Brain Injury at a public library, and patients navigating archives and records management to access their own mental health records will be presented. The panel members will provide insight on how to incorporate these communities into the services and programs offered at your institution._
