_Kent State University Archivist will highlight how their Department of Special Collections and Archives’ Black Campus Movement (BCM) project is helping to provide opportunities for collection development and fostering opportunities to work with faculty on integrating primary resources highlighting under-documented communities into instructional design. Arizona State University Librarians will illuminate community engagement through an examination of outreach activities within their respective unique collections; the Labriola National American Indian Data Center, the Chicano/a Research Collection, the Jewish Studies Collection, and the China Studies Collection. Participants will learn how to engage different demographics via acquisition, instructional design, exhibits, grant projects, public events, social media, web applications, and digital repositories._
