_The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Diversity Committee has taken up the task of revising the ACRL Diversity Standards for greater inclusivity. Initial feedback was gathered through a survey in the summer of 2015. This roundtable will discuss the rationale behind revising the standards, speak to the changing organizational climate in academic libraries around diversity, and share best practices on how to engage with cultural competencies at an academic library._
