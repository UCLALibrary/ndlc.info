_Youth-focused LIS educators, librarians, and authors will facilitate this roundtable to address how everyone can harness the power of the WNDB movement toward more inclusive literature, curriculum, programming, and partnerships. After the facilitators share their own work within the field, participants will share successful ideas and lessons learned from challenging experiences and brainstorm creative ways we might make progress with the WNDB movement in the future in and across our various spaces and communities. _
