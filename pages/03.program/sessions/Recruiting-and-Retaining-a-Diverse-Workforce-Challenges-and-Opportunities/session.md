_This roundtable will facilitate a constructive conversation about the challenges and opportunities in our professionâ€™s attempts to recruit and retain a diverse workforce. Panelists and audience members will discuss the issues involved, successes, and shortcomings in work at organizational, inter-institutional, and national levels.
