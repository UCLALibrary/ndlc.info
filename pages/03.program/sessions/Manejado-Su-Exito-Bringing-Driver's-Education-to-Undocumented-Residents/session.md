_A goal of the Orange County Public Libraries is to embrace diversity, respond effectively to community needs, and ensure language inclusion. As Latinos continue to be one of the fastest growing population groups in California, Manejando su Exito/ Driving Your Success, supports the journey of undocumented patrons in obtaining their driver’s licenses, allowing them to reach personal and professional accomplishments.
