_(* In attendance.) Understanding cultural health values and beliefs is an important aspect to integrate when delivering library services to diverse communities. This presentation will feature a discussion on the successful outreach services designed to reach Native nations in New Mexico inspired by the National Library of Medicine’s Exhibit, “Native Voices.” Additionally, an embedded librarian will discuss her approach to incorporate Latino cultural assets as a framework for providing health information to her clients._
