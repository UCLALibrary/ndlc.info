_The problematic nature of cataloging standards is nothing new to those interested in diversity in libraries and information sciences. In 2008, a call to the profession was sent out about ways to both constructively critique and teach the problematic catalog, but how has the field responded? (Roberto & Berman). Building on this work I want to both examine and propose ways to teach the problematic catalog under a radical lens focusing on student inclusion in the conversation._
