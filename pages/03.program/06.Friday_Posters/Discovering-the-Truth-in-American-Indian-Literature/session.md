_Selecting and promoting books for readers that are written and illustrated by Native authors and illustrators should be a priority for every library from public to academic. This poster will highlight the best youth literature selected by the American Indian Library Association (AILA) Youth Literature Awards Committee for 2016 and a discussion on misrepresentations of American Indians in literature._
