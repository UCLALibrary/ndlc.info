_Inknography is a digital oral history collection of tattooed Asian Americans. Body modifications, especially tattoos, challenge the visual image of the “model minority” stereotype. Each interview explores balancing identities, microaggressions, perspectives in cultural representation, and understanding the inspiration behind their tattoos. The collection can teach young people of color how to handle microaggressions, encourage discussion about racism, and to remind students they are not alone in their experiences._
