_The diverse populations that librarians serve on a college campus have different scholarly communication concerns about open access, academic publishing, author rights, and related issues. Many academic libraries expect their librarians to have some working knowledge of scholarly communication, but not all campuses have a dedicated functional specialist. Two librarians at a large research institution will demonstrate their methods for identifying and adequately addressing these issues in their campus community._
