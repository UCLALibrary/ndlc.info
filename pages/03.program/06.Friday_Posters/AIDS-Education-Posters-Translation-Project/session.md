_Through the AIDS Education Posters Translation Project, we initiated and led the development of an experiential learning model in language classes that to date have focused on textbook-based learning. Together with language instructors, librarians facilitated student contributions to the online archives of the international AIDS Education Posters Collection. This collection documents advocacy campaigns to raise awareness of the global epidemic that affects all people, regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation._
