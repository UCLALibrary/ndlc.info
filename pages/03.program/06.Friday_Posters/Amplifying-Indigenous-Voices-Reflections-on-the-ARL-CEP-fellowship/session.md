_This poster explores our experiences as fellows of the Association of Research Libraries Career Enhancement Program; carrying out our internships at the University of Michigan in 2015, and the University of Washington in 2016.  We reflect on the benefits of diversity initiatives, and how they have created opportunities for us to further explore and uphold indigenous knowledge systems and inclusive pedagogy.  We also consider ways to increase participant success and retention in the LIS field._
