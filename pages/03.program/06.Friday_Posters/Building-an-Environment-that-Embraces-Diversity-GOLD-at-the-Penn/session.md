_This poster will present the road map, mission, and progress of Penn Librariesâ€™ Group On Library Diversity. Through its official charge, GOLD is addressing recruitment and retention of diverse staff; building awareness through increased participation in planning, workshops, and community activities designed to draw attention to and improve the climate of diversity within the libraries; and, reaching out to campus cultural centers and neighborhood schools to contribute to a learning environment in which every student thrives_
