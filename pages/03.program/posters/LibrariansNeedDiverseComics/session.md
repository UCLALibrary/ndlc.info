_Like most media, a majority of comics cater to a white cishet male audience with stories starring white cishet male heroes. Because these characters do not represent the diversity or demographics of the real world, they can alienate underrepresented socio-cultural groups, including but not limited to women, people of color, and LGBTQ+. This presentation provides recent statistics on diversity, recommendations for collection development including introductions to several award winning creators, and tips and tools to expand programming._
