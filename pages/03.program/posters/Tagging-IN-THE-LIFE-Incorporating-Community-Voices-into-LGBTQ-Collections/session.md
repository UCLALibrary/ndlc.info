_In 2015, the UCLA Film & Television Archive launched an online research portal dedicated to In the Life, television’s longest running LGBTQ news program. After cataloging episodes using traditional subject headings, the Archive solicited the input of my student group, LGBTQ Library & Archive OUTReach, to suggest tags for episodes to ensure the language used in the portal reflects community language. I wish to create a poster documenting the groups’ work on the project._
