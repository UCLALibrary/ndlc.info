_How can libraries facilitate open conversation about race, gender, and social justice in order to build bridges to inclusion? Librarians at Michigan State University (MSU) work closely with the MSU Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives to develop discussion-based programs in support of Project 60/50 (a university effort to facilitate community conversation on civil and human rights). This poster provides examples of award-winning programs and tips for collaborating effectively with campus partners to support diversity._
