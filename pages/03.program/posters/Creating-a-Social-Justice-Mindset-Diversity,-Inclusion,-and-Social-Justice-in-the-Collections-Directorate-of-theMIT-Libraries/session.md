_When we think of social justice in academic libraries, we often imagine inclusive public services and collections in spaces for research and student learning. Yet, itâ€™s critical for social justice to permeate throughout an entire organization. The Collections Directorate of the MIT Libraries sponsored a task force to identify opportunities for archives, technical services, preservation, and collections strategy staff to promote diversity, inclusion, and social justice. This poster presents the task force's recommendations._
