_This poster describes an ongoing collaboration between the Arizona Historical Society (AHS) and Special Collections, University of Arizona Libraries (UASC) to increase access for Spanish-literate users through select translation of our finding aids. Using quantitative and qualitative assessments for the identification of prospective translations, we explore how to best direct Spanish-literate researchers to materials of interest at AHS, UASC, or elsewhere. _
