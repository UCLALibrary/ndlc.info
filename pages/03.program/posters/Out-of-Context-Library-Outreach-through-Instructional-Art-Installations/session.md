_The Context Library Series at California State University San Marcos confronts conventional notions of library outreach and programming with experiential, instructional exhibits that support student learning in creative and provocative ways. Poster will highlight two exhibits: “More than a Fence,” which gave students an interactive space to share stories and experiences on immigration and the US/Mexico border, and “Beyond the Stereotype” where participants pledged to speak out against racial and cultural appropriation on campus._
