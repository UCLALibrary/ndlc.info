_Accessing scholarly resources can be challenging for many students but using screen readers to access information adds a layer of complexity to information seeking.  This poster will present the results of a usability study of database accessibility. The study participants include one group who use screen readers for their research and another group who do not use screen readers. Results will be used to advocate for equitable access for all students._
