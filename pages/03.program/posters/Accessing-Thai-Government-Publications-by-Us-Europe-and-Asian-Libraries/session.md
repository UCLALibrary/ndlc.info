_Access to government information in Thailand is significantly different in both the government structure and distribution of Thai publications.  This poster looks at Thai- produced government publications that are accessible outside of Thailand.  Specifically, I access the types of institutions in the United States, Europe, and Asia that hold forty-seven selected Thai government serial publications by utilizing OCLC WorldCat data. OCLC records provide descriptive bibliographic information and the location of items held by member libraries._
