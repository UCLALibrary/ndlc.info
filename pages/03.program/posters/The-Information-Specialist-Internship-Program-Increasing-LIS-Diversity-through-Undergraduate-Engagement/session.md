_The Information Specialist Internship Program (ISIP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries aspires to increase diversity of the library profession by providing undergraduates from historically underrepresented groups an opportunity to obtain knowledge and experience in information and library services. The internship is designed to increase awareness of information specialists, and develop a diverse learning community. This poster will describe the goals of the internship as well as the satisfactions and challenges of running the program._
