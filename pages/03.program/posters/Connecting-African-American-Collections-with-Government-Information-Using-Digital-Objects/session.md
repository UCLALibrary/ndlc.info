_As the African American Studies Librarian, it is sometimes difficult to allow students brain-friendly methods for interacting with various collections. What are effective ways to connect them with the library and other collections? As the government collections and libraryâ€™s collections attempt to shift from analog to digital spaces for engagement, there may be ways to allow for interaction and inspiration through digital collections and platforms. How do we promote access to diverse learners?_
