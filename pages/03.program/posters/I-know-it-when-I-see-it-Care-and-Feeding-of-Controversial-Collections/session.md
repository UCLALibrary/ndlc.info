_The Indiana University Libraries system is home to a number of collections that defy standard expectations of what research collections should contain and often rub against the delicate sensibilities of patrons. Through stories and examples, this poster will contend with how collections containing sensitive subject matter are developed, maintained, and made accessible, with a special emphasis on what it means to provide access to materials that some might find offensive or even obscene._
