_Asian cultural traditions are deeply valued by Asians, including American-born Asians.  The problem, however, is that by upholding many of the Asian cultural traditions many Asian Americans find it challenging to develop some of the essential American-centered leadership skills.  Consequently, they fail to attain leadership positions in academic and research libraries. This presentation discusses ways that Asian Americans can acquire some of the essential American-centered leadership skills._
