_A recent study in the Journal of Academic Librarianship measures racial microaggression experiences in the academic library setting, however, the study does not include medical librarians as part of the population. This poster will include information about what microaggressions are, the group’s research process, and our work towards developing a good tool to measure racial microaggressions among medical librarians and library staff from colleagues and the library’s community of users._
