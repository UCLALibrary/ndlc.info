_The LAUC-B Committee on Diversity (CoD) has existed for at least 20 years; recent years saw a waning in its activities.  A task force convened in 2014 to revise the CoD’s charge, hoping to revitalize the group, and effect change in the diversity of professional librarians. The CoD has since sponsored several events, and reinstated a librarian/staff mentoring program. While the CoD’s re-invigoration has received praise, work remains. Librarian diversity (particularly in terms of numbers from underrepresented minorities) remains low, but working toward culture change may be all the CoD can do._
