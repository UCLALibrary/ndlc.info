_The Hindu caste system positions Dalits, also known as untouchables, at the bottom. This inequality manifests itself into continual injustices. Dalit resources are essential because marginalized voices can be heard only if they are included. However, building such a collection is complex since much of the material is developed overseas and often requires knowledge of South Asian vernacular languages. This poster explores the development of the South Asian Dalit collection at the University of Illinois._
