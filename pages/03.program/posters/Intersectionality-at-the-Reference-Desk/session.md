_This poster presentation shares findings from our research study on the lived experiences of women of color librarians working in public services. We used a feminist interview approach to focus on voices that have traditionally been overlooked and devalued in LIS literature. We will explore intersectionality, microaggressions, and gendered expectations in the workplace._
