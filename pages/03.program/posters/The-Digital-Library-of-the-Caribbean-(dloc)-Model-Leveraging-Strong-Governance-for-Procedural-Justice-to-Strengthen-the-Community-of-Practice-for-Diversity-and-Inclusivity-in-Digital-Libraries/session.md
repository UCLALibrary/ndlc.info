_This poster will introduce the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC; www.dloc.com), a collaborative, international digital library for resources from and about the Caribbean and circum-Caribbean, providing access and ensuring preservation for Caribbean cultural, historical, and research materials from archives, libraries, museums, and private collections. It will provide an overview of dLOCâ€™s contents, functionality, and robust governance structure for inclusivity and diversity as a unique case study and model for digital libraries._
