_Aozora Bunko is a Japanese literature database for public domain full-text records. The University of Florida libraries modified their approximately 5,000 Japanese language records into RDA compatible English language records, and added the MARC records to OCLC and the ILS in order to provide access and support inclusion by other academic libraries. Thus, this analytical cataloging project makes it possible to introduce more users to the Japanese anthologies in full text._
