_This proposed project will be a qualitative study evaluating 4 public library board structures in two western Canadian provinces mainly their members, activities and training received.  The aim of this study is to evaluate whether boards are representative of their growing culturally diverse populations, trained to be culturally sensitive, knowledgeable about the needs of their growing diverse user groups and able to direct their libraries to meet the needs of their user groups._
