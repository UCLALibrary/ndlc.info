_What happens when you remove the word "minority" from a residency program initially created to increase diversity in the profession? This poster describes the effect of such a change at a public midwestern university library, where threats of reverse discrimination litigation caused the "Minority Resident Librarian" program to be re-named as the "Academic Resident Librarian" program. The poster suggests that names matter, and that diversity must be intentional and not coincidental._
