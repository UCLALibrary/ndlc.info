_Hathcock’s (2015) criticism of the Association of Research Library’s diversity initiatives argued that the programs focus on simply increasing numbers without addressing long-term retention. The purpose of the poster session is to highlight the benefits of peer mentoring as an ongoing resource among alumni Diversity Scholars to help with career advancement. The poster will discuss current retention rates for ARL Diversity Scholars and focus group/survey results that measure the impact of the Scholars’ peer mentoring experiences._
