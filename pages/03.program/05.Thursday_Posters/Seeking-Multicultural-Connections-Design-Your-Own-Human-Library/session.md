_Discover an innovative way for academic libraries to increase awareness of diversity issues, civic, responsibility, and global engagement through The Human Library.  The Human Library, created by an international organization, humanlibrary.org, consists of sessions where readers are able to “check out” a “human book” who has a story to share about his/her experiences with stereotyping or prejudice. Through meaningful conversations, “readers” listen to a “book” chosen from the available catalog that addresses a personally held prejudice in order to appreciate the humanity in all people._
