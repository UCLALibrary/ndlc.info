_Common Good is an outreach initiative focused on creating discussions within the UVA community that feature concerns of equality, diversity, and social justice around student life in higher education. Through a series of different types of programs, we've been able to partner with other organizations to feature conversations in a variety of settings from panel discussions on trigger warnings to a Wikipedia edit-a-thons on black stories at the university, and gender violence._
