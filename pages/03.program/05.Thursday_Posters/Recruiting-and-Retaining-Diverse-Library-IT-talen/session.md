_In this poster, we present research and practices that help libraries recruit and retain employees for technology jobs. We will summarize results from a survey of library IT staff, identifying key factors that influence recruitment and retention and whether those factors are consistent across settings and demographic groups.  Then, based on those factors, we will offer concrete suggestions for recruiting and retaining talented employees in library IT positions._
