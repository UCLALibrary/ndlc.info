_UCLA Library is the hub for a cross-campus team which develops a toolkit for delivering core competencies to diverse communities of learners and researchers. The toolkit allows instructors both in and out of the library to explore new instructional approaches, meet diverse learning needs, and incorporate accessible online, hybrid, and face-to-face teaching methods. In this poster session, we will discuss methods and tips to start a similar project at your institution._
