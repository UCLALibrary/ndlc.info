_Iowa State University is located in the middle of a state whose population is 92% White. The university's demographics are similarly homogenous, with 71â€“86% of students, faculty and staff identifying as White. Our poster highlights steps taken and programs implemented to reinvigorate a library diversity committee at a predominantly White institution. Information will be provided on efforts to diversify staff, increase cultural competency, and combat racism and identity-based prejudice of all kinds._
