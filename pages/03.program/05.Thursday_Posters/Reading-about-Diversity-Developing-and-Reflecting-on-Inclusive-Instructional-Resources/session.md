_Members of the ACRL Instruction Section Instruction for Diverse Populations Committee describe their process in collaboratively revising and developing resources to support instruction librarians working with diverse populations. The panelists will share highlights from the newly updated Library Instruction for Diverse Populations Bibliography, identify gaps in the literature on instruction for diverse populations, and reflect on how these resources relate to their own institutional contexts and initiatives._
