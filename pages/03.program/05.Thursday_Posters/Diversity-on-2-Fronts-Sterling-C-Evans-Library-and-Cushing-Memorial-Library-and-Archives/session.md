_This poster will highlight the collaboration between the Texas A&M Universityâ€™s library and archive to promote its collections, programming, and outreach activities that offer a model for others to imitate.  The centerpiece of the discussion will be the acquisition of a significant collection, the Don Kelly Research Collection on Gay Literature and Culture that drew support from the campus and surrounding community._
