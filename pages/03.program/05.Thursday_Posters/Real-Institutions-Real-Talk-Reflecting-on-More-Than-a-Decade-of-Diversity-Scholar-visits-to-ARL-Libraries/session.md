_As part of ARLâ€™s Initiative to Recruit a Diverse Workforce scholarship program, Diversity Scholars visit an ARL library to observe firsthand the realities of academic librarianship. A panel of two librarians from hosting institutions and two IRDW alumni will reflect on the benefits and value of these site visits. Moderated by the IRDW program director, panelists will discuss programming components, and share perspectives on the impact of this program for hosting institutions and visiting scholars._
