_This presentation will share the excitement and momentum that our library diversity group experienced by creating a mobile app to highlight renovated facilities, assist underserved people, and make our campus more inclusive. We will take the conference participants through the processes that we used to identify and prioritize underserved groups, to build cross-campus partnerships, to discover resources, and to develop the functionality and interface for our open-source mobile app called The Inclusive U._
