_The urgency of representing African American history as fully as possible drives Umbra: Search African American History (umbrasearch.org), a free online search tool that aggregates and makes discoverable nearly 500,000 digitized materials from over 500 US libraries, archives, and cultural heritage institutions. In aggregating these digital collections from across the country, Umbra leverages partnerships, open data platforms, and technologies to create access to a national digital collection of African American cultural history._
