_The University of Wisconsin-Madison General Library System (GLS) created a Diversity Task Force to develop a sustainable plan to integrate diversity efforts in staffing and services The Task Force defined diversity and inclusion for the GLS and determined where we are on our path to becoming an inclusive organization. Based on the findings, we made recommendations, including specific actions and accountability. We will share the lessons learned, and facilitate a discussion on challenges moving forward._
