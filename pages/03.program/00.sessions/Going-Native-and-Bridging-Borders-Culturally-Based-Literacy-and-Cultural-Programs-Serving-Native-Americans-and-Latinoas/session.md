_This panel discussion will provide an overview of two unique programs focusing on culturally-based outcomes and outreach. Two MLIS students at St. Catherine University have undertaken a community-based research project to assess such outcomes through dramatic pedagogy among 8-10 year-old urban Native students in Minneapolis, Minnesota, identifying new and more culturally appropriate forms of literacy.  An overview of Bridging Borders, a program for teen girls, and a book and mural project highlighting Latino/a history and heritage will be provided, addressing the development, challenges, and outcomes of these programs._
