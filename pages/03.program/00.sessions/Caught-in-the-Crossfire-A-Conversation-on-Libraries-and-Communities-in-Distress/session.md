_In this town hall, facilitators will share brief comments regarding the role of libraries in times of crises, including ideas such as the need to integrate critical approaches into LIS education and programming; the need for strong community partnerships; strategies for self-care; legal considerations regarding protest and free speech; and how LIS education may play a role in preparing future LIS professionals. We also wish to interrogate the idea of the library as a place of neutrality, a phrase that we have seen made by public librarians on social media. The remaining time will be spent facilitating a town hall discussion strategizing action steps._
