_Community archives are independent, grassroots organizations that enable members of minoritized communities to 
document their own histories. This panel addresses how recent changes in archival practice have impacted communities 
who have not previously seen themselves represented in mainstream archives. Based on their research and practice with several communities-including Indigenous, Asian American, and queer communities-the panelists will offer new and exciting ways to think about and evaluate the impact of such archival endeavors._
