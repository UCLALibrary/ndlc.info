_This presentation describes a library/faculty collaboration on an undergraduate women’s studies assignment: students begin research by visiting the Augustana human library and “reading” human books who speak about firsthand experiences relating to sex, gender, and sexuality. Past topics have included eating disorders, being transgender, bisexuality, and sexual abuse. Students reflect that the assignment provides them with a unique, immersive learning experience by allowing them to engage with both oral narratives and traditional scholarly information sources._
