_The Context Library Series at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) confronts conventional notions of library outreach and programming with experiential, instructional exhibits as visual and cultural representations of the curriculum. Each exhibit provides meaningful opportunities for situated and self-directed student learning, exemplifying the inherent role of a library as an active learning laboratory. This presentation will share insights from the seriesâ€™ 25 exhibits, with a focus on the role of art exhibits in facilitating campus conversations on cultural diversity._
