_Even though many libraries are struggling to give voice to transgender experiences, the lives of most transgender 
people remain unassessed and undervalued. As a result, our collections, our outreach, and our facilities (or lack, 
thereof) all come together to reinforce cultural expectations which delegitimize transgender persons. If we want our libraries to be truly inclusive, we need to reconsider the points of contact between various library spaces and the needs of transgender persons._
