_With the heightened focus on diversity and inclusion in LIS spaces and other segments of U.S. society, difficult 
conversations, and often confrontation around racism and other forms of oppression, have increased in libraries, 
classrooms, and other physical and virtual settings. Two LIS educators / librarians will facilitate this roundtable discussion on informing practice through different identities, intersectionalities, and privileges, and contesting microaggressions and other forms of silencing through empathy and cultural competence. _
