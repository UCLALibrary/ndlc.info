_Current trends indicate that foreign language study in academia is in continuous flux and library collections 
supporting those programs are in constant change as well.  But are language programs the only reason to build foreign
 language collections?  International users often feel alienated when it comes to library programs, services and collections.  This study focuses on the assessment of foreign language collections to support the academic and cultural needs of international users._
