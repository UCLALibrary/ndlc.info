_This panel of staff, faculty, and administrators from the University of Kansas Libraries, offers perspectives on meeting the challenges posed by student activists. We will discuss how our response to a town hall forum on race developed and our efforts to create a multi-faceted approach to integrating social justice into our organizational structure. We will end with facilitated group discussions on how others might attempt to change their institutional cultures and consider potential challenges._
