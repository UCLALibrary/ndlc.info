_Archives and archivists are entrusted with preserving and providing access to the histories of communities and 
people, which includes documenting the diversity and changing needs of those communities and people. This session 
explores the challenges of locating voices of underrepresented communities in archival research, and discusses efforts to create a more inclusive record in the archives. The speakers will examine the ways in which archives can either establish or build upon past efforts for diverse holdings, using examples of case studies, oral histories, collection development policies, collaborative outreach programs, staff training and online programs._
