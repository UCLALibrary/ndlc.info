_This presentation will cover climate assessments from start to finish. Panelists from five institutions will discuss lessons learned for each step: motivations for a climate assessment; instrument selection; building trust and encouraging participation; interpreting results and communicating results; prioritizing attention areas; interventions; and outcome assessment. Presenters will address a variety of climate assessment tools including ClimateQUAL® and home-grown surveys, and an array of data visualizations, communication methods, results assessments, and diversity action plans._
