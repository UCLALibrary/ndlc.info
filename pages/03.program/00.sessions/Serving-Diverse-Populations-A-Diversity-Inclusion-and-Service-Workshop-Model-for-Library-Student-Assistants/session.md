_The Z. Smith Reynolds Library at Wake Forest University values the library as a place where everyone is welcome, and
 is committed to providing faculty and staff with ample opportunities for diversity and inclusion training. The ZSR 
 Library decided to take this one step further and offer this training to our 200+ student workers. Our presentation will describe the student learning session entitled “Serving Diverse Populations” and the exercises we designed._
