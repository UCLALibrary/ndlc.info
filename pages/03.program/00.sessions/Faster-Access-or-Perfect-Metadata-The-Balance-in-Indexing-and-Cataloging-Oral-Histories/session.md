_Go For Broke National Education Center (GFBNEC) is building a mixed-media digital archive of Japanese American 
military service. The project is utilizing the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS) to index oral histories at 
the segment level and more traditional cataloging at the item level.  Tension exists between rich indexing and dissemination with use of the OHMS application and Omeka web-publishing server. The presentation will discuss these conceptual issues such as metadata migration and storage, keyword and subject thesauri development and utilization, tags, automated and manual processes and workflow processes._
