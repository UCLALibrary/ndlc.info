_During October 2015, the Western Washington University Libraries Usability; Design Working Group conducted an electronic accessibility audit of the organizationâ€™s website. The purpose of the audit was to identify existing electronic barriers that people with disabilities may encounter as they navigate the website, and to make recommendations for future improvements. Attendees of this session will gain new knowledge and receive practical resources in order to begin this conversation within their own library._
