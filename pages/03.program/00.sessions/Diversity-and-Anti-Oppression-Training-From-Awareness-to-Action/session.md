_The University of Illinois Libraries have gradually increased interest, involvement, and proactive energy in helping
 library faculty, staff, and patrons gain awareness of the impact of microaggressions and white privilege. This presentation will describe our methodologies and the self-paced training series that was developed in Blackboard to help library faculty and staff get more immersed in critical issues to address racial justice in our workplaces, and to move beyond awareness to action._
