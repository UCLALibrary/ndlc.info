_Since 2001 initiatives aiming to increase the number of librarians from ethnically/culturally underrepresented groups flourished as libraries raced to meet the diverse needs of their users. National programs such as Knowledge River and Spectrum, and University of California Santa Barbara’s innovative and then controversial Library Fellowship program, and regional programs such as University of California Riverside’s Inland Empire LEADS (Librarians Educated to Advance Diversity & Service), aim to shape the future of librarianship and libraries. This program will present research on these programs, discuss the long term impact they had on the face of profession and how developing partnerships play a vital role in their success._
