_Libraries are building makerspaces and developing making programs to broaden access to digital and physical fabrication, and to further their technological and informational literacy programs.  This panel discussion will examine maker initiatives emerging from public and academic libraries, and within the broader DIY movement. Presentations will focus on how to build inclusive communities within makerspaces, how to develop programming that addresses a range of populations, and discuss strategies for fostering diversity, inclusion, and accessibility._
