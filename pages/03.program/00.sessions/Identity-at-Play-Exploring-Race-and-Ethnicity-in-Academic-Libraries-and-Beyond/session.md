_Why do mentoring programs that pair Black male librarians see success? Why does a Muslim student approach a librarian wearing a hijab first at the reference desk? Can an instruction session become enriched when a librarian shares personal stories about being first-generation? This panel presentation is an immersion into racial and ethnic identity theory, applied as a framework, in order for participants to develop skills and vocabulary to articulate, recognize, and apply at their institutions._
