_A panel of librarians will unpack the Diversity Standards developed by the Racial and Ethnic Diversity Committee of ACRL. How do we envision ourselves as culturally competent? How do we engage with these cultural competencies and how do we assess our endeavors through these Diversity Standards? What if our institutions or colleagues have not embraced the Standards? How are cultural competencies valued--both at the individual and/or institutional level? Join this interactive conversation modeled by the World Café method._
