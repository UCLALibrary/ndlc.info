_Restrooms have recently become a prominent battleground for trans* rights and advocacy. In an effort to provide more
 inclusive services to traditionally marginalized members of our community, E. H. Butler Library at SUNY Buffalo State transformed previously gendered restrooms to gender neutral restrooms. This session will discuss the process behind E. H. Butler Libraryâ€™s trans* ally initiative, and its goals to create more inclusive spaces and increase awareness of trans* issues across campus._
