_This roundtable will facilitate a conversation centered on diversity committees in libraries. Five speakers will 
share their experiences building, sustaining and reinventing diversity committees at their respective institutions. 
This session hopes to be a springboard for dialogue. It will foster a free flow of information amongst the speakers and participants. This roundtable seeks to empower librarians and to create a network of collective wisdom and continued sharing that extends beyond the NDLC._
