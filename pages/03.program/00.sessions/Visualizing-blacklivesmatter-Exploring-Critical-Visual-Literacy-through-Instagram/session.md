_This paper will examine visual literacy within the context of using Instagram. Instagram provides a platform for sharing and discovering images from all over the world. Within the posted images, account holders share details about their images and add hashtags. Followers are allowed to like, discuss, and provide additional hashtags to a post. In the case of #blacklivesmatter, how can images with this hashtag provide strategies for applying visual literacy activities in library instruction sessions?_
