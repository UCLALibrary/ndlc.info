_For years stories of why underrepresented minorities leave the profession have dominated library literature. Panelists will discuss the challenges they have faced in the profession but also discuss their motivations to stay and seek leadership opportunities in academic libraries. These veteran librarians will discuss strategies that have worked for them and what advice they would give to others that could help increase retention numbers of underrepresented minority academic librarians._
