_We will showcase examples of grassroots approaches to creating formal and informal peer mentoring groups. Peer mentoring led by people of color is an approach to mentorship that creates safe spaces and the ability to define a professional and personal identity. We will also address the challenges and opportunities presented by such models, including their effects on early career development. Join us as we discuss perspectives in creating diversity networks for collaborative growth._
