_Whiteness “an ideological practice that can extend beyond race to other areas of dominance” has permeated every 
aspect of librarianship, including our diversity initiatives. This state of affairs, however, need not remain. This 
paper examines the ways in which whiteness controls diversity initiatives in LIS, particularly in light of the application requirements set upon candidates. I then suggest ways to correct for whiteness in LIS diversity programs by providing mentorship and concurrently working to dismantle whiteness from within._
