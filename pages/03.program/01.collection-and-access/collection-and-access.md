## Collections & Access
_This is a list of preliminary sessions_

**Do We Walk the Walk, or Just Talk the Talk? Library Practices around Intersectional Needs**

Melissa Villa-Nicholas, Ph.D. student, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Graduate School of Library and Information Science 

Jeanie Austin, Ph.D. student, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Graduate School of Library and Information Science

Christina J. Woo, Research Librarian, University of California, Irvine
 
_This panel examines how library practices represent racial, gender, and sexual norms through core functions, 
including collections, instruction, and programming. The presenters analyze how libraries reproduce and resist racism
 and heteronormativity, and how those productions of knowledge reflect or reject the larger communities. How does your library approach immigrants'/migrants' needs?  How do LGBTQ+ youth evaluate library materials specific to their experience and identity?  How do you include the under-represented in your library's spaces, webpages, and publications?_

engage communities in preserving their history through creating Latino digital collections. LDAG has two components:  1. facilitating heritage fairs that will provide learning opportunities and hands-on use of technology; 2. bringing together information professionals and representatives of state and national digital initiatives to lend their expertise by teaching concepts related to digital technology._

_Archives and archivists are entrusted with preserving and providing access to the histories of communities and 
people, which includes documenting the diversity and changing needs of those communities and people. This session 
explores the challenges of locating voices of underrepresented communities in archival research, and discusses efforts to create a more inclusive record in the archives. The speakers will examine the ways in which archives can either establish or build upon past efforts for diverse holdings, using examples of case studies, oral histories, collection development policies, collaborative outreach programs, staff training and online programs._

Kelli Ham, Consumer Health and Technology Coordinator, National Network of Libraries of Medicine, Pacific Southwest Region, UCLA Biomedical Library 

Patrick Burke, Coordinator, UCLA Office of Information Technology, Disabilities and Computing Program

_Digital content is ubiquitous, expanding information access in previously unimaginable ways. Powerful tools allow 
users to create and disseminate content in numerous formats, including complex documents, visually-intense 
presentations, and compelling multimedia. However, much of this content is inaccessible to people who have disabilities. Attend this session to see demonstrations of assistive technologies, to learn about Section 508 compliance, and to learn strategies and techniques to improve accessibility and inclusion for all users of our content. _

Ricky Punzalan, Assistant Professor, College of Information Studies University of Maryland

Jamie A. Lee, Assistant Professor, School of Information University of Arizona

_Community archives are independent, grassroots organizations that enable members of minoritized communities to 
document their own histories. This panel addresses how recent changes in archival practice have impacted communities 
who have not previously seen themselves represented in mainstream archives. Based on their research and practice with several communities-including Indigenous, Asian American, and queer communities-the panelists will offer new and exciting ways to think about and evaluate the impact of such archival endeavors._

**Are We Doing Enough?: Three Stories of Diversity in Library Collections**

Eugenia Beh, Electronic Resources Librarian, MIT

Jade Alburo, Librarian for Southeast Asian and Pacific Islands Studies, UCLA

Paolo Gujilde, Coordinator of Collection Development, Georgia Southern University 
 
_Do your collections reflect the diversity of your constituents? Are you equipped to meet the diverse needs of future
 users? In light of budgetary and spatial challenges, diversity in collections may not be a priority for most 
 libraries. Yet, changing demographics practically ensures that there will be an increase in the demand for diverse materials. See how librarians from 3 different types of academic institutions from 3 different regions have been dealing with (or not) with this issue._

**Building Diverse and Inclusive Collections Using Assessment and Data Visualization**

This session features two presentations on using different assessment methods to create more inclusive library collections.

Inclusion Through Collection Building: A Study of Foreign Language Collections Usage by International Students, Faculty and Staff  
Andrea Malone, Foreign Languages & Ethnic Studies, University of Houston

Current trends indicate that foreign language study in academia is in continuous flux and library collections supporting those programs are in constant change as well.  But are language programs the only reason to build foreign language collections?  International users often feel alienated when it comes to library programs, services and collections.  This study focuses on the assessment of foreign language collections to support the academic and cultural needs of international users.

Representing the Un/der-represented: Using Data Visualization to Explore Diversity and Inclusion for Academic Library Collections 
Bobby L. Smiley, Digital Scholarship and American History Librarian, Michigan State University Libraries  

Without institutional knowledge, or recent collections analysis, it is difficult to get purchase and perspective on how large research-intensive academic libraries address diversity and inclusion in their existing collections. Using Michigan State University Librariesâ€™ collections as an example, this presentation examines how data visualization furnishes pictorial, quantitative ways to discern trends, identify gaps and silences, and assess collection strengths in diversity and inclusion to help inform future collection development decisions.

**Cataloging for Diversity: Limits in Standards and Patron Discovery**

This session features two presentations on cataloging issues when taking diversity and inclusion into account.

Sara Howard, Reference Librarian, Wesleyan University 

The problematic nature of cataloging standards is nothing new to those interested in diversity in libraries and information sciences. In 2008, a call to the profession was sent out about ways to both constructively critique and teach the problematic catalog, but how has the field responded? (Roberto & Berman). Building on this work I want to both examine and propose ways to teach the problematic catalog under a radical lens focusing on student inclusion in the conversation. 
 
**Faster Access or Perfect Metadata? The Balance in Indexing and Cataloging Oral Histories**

Summer Espinoza, Digital Collections Manager, Go for Broke National Education Center

Linh Gavin Do, Associate Archivist, Go For Broke National Education Center

Erin Sato, Assistant Archivist, Go For Broke National Education Center

_Go For Broke National Education Center (GFBNEC) is building a mixed-media digital archive of Japanese American 
military service. The project is utilizing the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS) to index oral histories at 
the segment level and more traditional cataloging at the item level.  Tension exists between rich indexing and dissemination with use of the OHMS application and Omeka web-publishing server. The presentation will discuss these conceptual issues such as metadata migration and storage, keyword and subject thesauri development and utilization, tags, automated and manual processes and workflow processes._

Norda Majekodunmi, Associate Librarian/ Head, Scott Research & Collections, York University Libraries

Erin White, Web Systems Librarian, Virginia Commonwealth University

Alice Campbell, Digital Outreach and Special Projects Librarian, Virginia Commonwealth University (cannot attend, but is a co-author)

_Librarians from the Virginia Commonwealth Libraries, United States and York University/Osgoode Hall Law School 
Libraries, Canada have developed digital projects to build awareness about diversity, racial discrimination, 
religious persecution and multicultural communities. This combined presentation discusses the unique ways digital projects help us expand the library/librarians' role in promoting widespread, meaningful dialogue, historical awareness, and preservation of indigenous knowledge to diverse audiences._
