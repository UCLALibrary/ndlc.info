## Challenging Topics
_This is a list of preliminary sessions_

Dr. Nicole A. Cooke, Assistant Professor, The Graduate School of Library and Information Science, University of Illinois

Dr. Robin F. Kurz, Assistant Professor, The School of Library and Information Management, Emporia State University

_With the heightened focus on diversity and inclusion in LIS spaces and other segments of U.S. society, difficult 
conversations, and often confrontation around racism and other forms of oppression, have increased in libraries, 
classrooms, and other physical and virtual settings. Two LIS educators / librarians will facilitate this roundtable discussion on informing practice through different identities, intersectionalities, and privileges, and contesting microaggressions and other forms of silencing through empathy and cultural competence. _

_A new wave of student activism reminds us that libraries are central to the lives of students as a place of study, 
socializing, rest, and engagement with conversations larger than themselves. In this workshop, we will share examples
 of libraries challenging and transcending a transactional model to forge solidarities with campus communities. Join us to discuss critical frameworks around ally-ship and solidarity, and to collectively develop strategies for engaging in transformative social justice work._

**White Librarianship in Blackface: Oppressive Normativity and Diversity Initiatives in LIS**

April Hathcock, Scholarly Communication Librarian, New York University  
 
_Whiteness “an ideological practice that can extend beyond race to other areas of dominance” has permeated every 
aspect of librarianship, including our diversity initiatives. This state of affairs, however, need not remain. This 
paper examines the ways in which whiteness controls diversity initiatives in LIS, particularly in light of the application requirements set upon candidates. I then suggest ways to correct for whiteness in LIS diversity programs by providing mentorship and concurrently working to dismantle whiteness from within._

_Microaggressions are brief, commonplace indignities that continue to affect individuals from marginalized 
communities. In libraries, they can occur among and between library employees and patrons. In this roundtable 
session, we will introduce microaggressions and their impact within the library community and discuss microactivism as a proactive response to microaggressions (and macroaggressions), followed by a facilitated discussion and storytelling opportunity among participants, in which we document microaggressions on Post-its to be used for the LIS Microaggressions blog and a special NDLC zine._
