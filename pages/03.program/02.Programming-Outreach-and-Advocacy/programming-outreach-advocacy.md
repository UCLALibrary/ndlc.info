**Do We Walk the Walk, or Just Talk the Talk? Library Practices Around Intersectional Needs**

Jeanie Austin, Ph.D. student, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Graduate School of Library and Information Science

Christina J. Woo, Research Librarian, University of California, Irvine
 
_This panel examines how library practices represent racial, gender, and sexual norms through core functions, 
including collections, instruction, and programming. The presenters analyze how libraries reproduce and resist racism
 and heteronormativity, and how those productions of knowledge reflect or reject the larger communities. How does your library approach immigrants'/migrants' needs?  How do LGBTQ+ youth evaluate library materials specific to their experience and identity?  How do you include the under-represented in your library's spaces, webpages, and publications?_

**Educating the Educators: Proactive Approaches to the Inclusive Classroom**

Shannon Simpson, Student Engagement and Information Fluency Librarian, Johns Hopkins University 

Macie Hall, Senior Instructional Designer, Johns Hopkins University

Paula M Smith, Associate Librarian, Penn State Abington 

Dolores Rafter-Arevalo, Coordinator, Office of Global Programs, Penn State Abington

_As demographics and attention on our college campuses are finally shifting to reflect our increasingly diverse 
world, our classrooms must meet the needs and challenge the assumptions of both students and faculty from myriad 
experiences and backgrounds. This interactive and resource filled session will present approaches by 2 institutions that are working to foster proactive classroom approaches to inclusion. The Global Awareness Dialogue Project (GADP) at Penn State Abington is a faculty development initiative, aimed at increasing the collective cultural understanding and competence of the faculty while examining the changing dynamics in the classroom space. TILE: The Toolkit for Inclusive Learning Environments developed at John Hopkins University contains engaging pedagogically based classroom activities designed for faculty to help students interact more meaningfully in myriad areas of diversity, through their chosen discipline. By educating the educators, both projects present ways in which inclusivity can be thought of and integrated into the classroom in an intentional rather than reactive manner. Presenters will share with participants their accumulated resources and how they can partner with campus stakeholders to help create inclusive learning environments._

_The lack of consistent wide-spread media coverage of recent events in North America involving violence against 
Native Americans and African Americans in the U.S., led the authors to closely examine where, and by whom these 
events were being reported.  A review of media sources revealed uneven coverage of recent tragic events. The researchers undertook a project to compare and analyze the lyrics of Native American rappers and Tupac Shakur, an African American rapper whose lyrics reflected his life experiences._

_This presentation describes a library/faculty collaboration on an undergraduate women’s studies assignment: students
 begin research by visiting the Augustana human library and “reading” human books who speak about firsthand 
 experiences relating to sex, gender, and sexuality. Past topics have included eating disorders, being transgender, bisexuality, and sexual abuse. Students reflect that the assignment provides them with a unique, immersive learning experience by allowing them to engage with both oral narratives and traditional scholarly information sources._

**Visualizing #blacklivesmatter: Exploring Critical Visual Literacy through Instagram**

Stacy R. Williams, Head, Architecture and Fine Arts Library, University of Southern California

_This paper will examine visual literacy within the context of using Instagram. Instagram provides a platform for 
sharing and discovering images from all over the world. Within the posted images, account holders share details about
 their images and add hashtags. Followers are allowed to like, discuss, and provide additional hashtags to a post. In the case of #blacklivesmatter, how can images with this hashtag provide strategies for applying visual literacy activities in library instruction sessions?_

Lisa Valdez, Librarian, Los Angeles Pierce College
 
_Librarians from USC will report a survey of academic libraries on current services and resources offered to student 
veterans, as well as to assess student veterans’ information needs and identify challenges and barriers of working 
with them. One example took place at L.A. Pierce College, where the library presented programming related to the veteran experience tied in to the college’s One Book-One Campus program. This resulted in greater outreach to the campus veteran community through student curriculum and campus events._

Annie Pho, Inquiry and Instruction Librarian for Peer-to-Peer Services and Public Programming, UC Los Angeles

_Wikipedia is a widely-used resource for information, but there’s always room for improvement when it comes to 
underrepresented entry subjects, especially in academic environments. Many instructors hesitate to use Wikipedia as a
 trusted source, but bringing students, faculty and community members together at Wiki Edit-a-thons to understand how these pages are created and by whom (predominately white men), and then to create new pages featuring diverse or underrepresented people/subjects, is a deep dive into the research cycle. If possible, create or bring your Wikipedia log in and laptop so we can do some hands on editing. Beginners are welcome._

Emily Drabinski, Coordinator of Library Instruction, Long Island University Brooklyn

Harrison Inefuku, Digital Repository Coordinator, Iowa State University

_Countless studies and personal narratives have demonstrated that cultural, racial, and gender bias influence 
important aspects of academia, including in traditional book and journal publishing. Scholarly communications and LIS
 publishing can challenge the traditional modes of publishing both in format and content. Panelists will discuss their work in this area, addressing topics like race, culture, sexuality, and gender in formats like print books, online journals, and institutional repositories. _
