_The Americans with Disabilities Act requires online information to be accessible to individuals with visual impairments â€“ but how does that affect special collections libraries with resources that are heavily invested in visual representations? This project will determine if institutional records for visual resources provide enough information to meet the requirements outlined by the ADA and provide patrons who have visual impairments enough information to understand if a resource may be relevant to their needs._
