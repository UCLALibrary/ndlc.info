_This poster describes a less frequently surfaced form of diversity, that is, diversity as an outcome of exposing 
hidden research library collections. The University of Michigan Library holds a set of 19th-century Japanese maps. 
They cannot be exhibited readily, and the fact that they are in Japanese creates a linguistic barrier for the map 
librarians. The maps became exposed when a Japanese studies professor held a graduate seminar exploring digital uses 
of them._
