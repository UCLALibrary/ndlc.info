_Traditionally, academic library outreach is informational, marketing library resources to campus.  On campuses with underrepresented and underserved communities, library outreach well-focused and directed becomes transformational, strengthening communities, fostering diversity through education, and highlighting the library's role in furthering the campus' commitment to diversity.  This poster focuses on how the UCSD Library developed exhibits and events that focused on gaps in the campus community, and will share strategies for engaging community/campus partners, and linking outreach efforts to strategic plans._
