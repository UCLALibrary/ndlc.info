_In 2012, ACRL published Diversity Standards: Cultural Competency for Academic Libraries to guide academic libraries to better serve diverse populations. How do academic library diversity plans incorporate these ACRL standards? What standards are underrepresented? This poster will show intersections between diversity plans collected from U.S. academic libraries and the standards through content analysis. Those engaged in diversity efforts will learn how to integrate these standards into their own plans to ensure inclusive learning environments._
