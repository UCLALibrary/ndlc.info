_San Diego State University (SDSU) Library and Information Access established an Oral History Center with seed money from SDSU Presidentâ€™s Leadership Fund. The dedicated space is used to conduct biographical interviews from diverse participants with a connection to the San Diego region generally and SDSU specifically. This poster will focus on the short term and long term significance to SDSU and discuss ways this center and the oral histories recorded provide opportunities for campus and community collaborations._
