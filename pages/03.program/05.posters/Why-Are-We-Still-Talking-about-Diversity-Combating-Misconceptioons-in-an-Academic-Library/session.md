_This poster will present the assessment and intervention activities of individuals at a mid-sized academic library with respect to diversity personnel initiatives. Each year, library employees complete a survey designed to gauge satisfaction and areas for improvement. Qualitative data suggest that library staff are confused about definitions of diversity and/or lack requisite buy-in and interest in initiatives that address diversity concerns. The activities and outcomes of an intervention to address these issues will be discussed._
