_This study examines how American academic library directors resolve change conflict using Bolman and Deal's reframing change model as a guide, and the factors influencing the approaches used. Data were collected from an online survey and descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the collected data. Results demonstrate that directors used single, dual, and multiple approaches to resolve conflict. The results are helpful to better understand directors' attitudes and behaviors, and the influencing factors._
