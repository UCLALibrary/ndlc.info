_Early librarian or prospective librarian residency programs can provide new and creative entry points into the profession. Such pathways encourage greater variation in librarian skillsets as well as diversity in age, race and ethnicity. This poster will provide a unique perspective on residency-related initiatives by discussing public library, archive, academic library, and paraprofessional residency programs. The primary focus will be on the design and implementation of these programs, as well as resident first -hand experiences._
