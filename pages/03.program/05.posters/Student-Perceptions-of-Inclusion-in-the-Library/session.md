_In 2016, our library incorporated questions about inclusion into its annual student satisfaction survey. This poster will share the results of these survey questions and input from students on the library's efforts to be open and inclusive to all. In addition, this poster will discuss how the data gathered from this survey will be used to align with campus-wide priorities to improve inclusion._
