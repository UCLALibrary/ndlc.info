_We are engaged with community partners in our university’s short-stay international program with a Japanese university to develop outreach programming that helps these students learn about our library and all the services and resources it can offer them.  We have emphasized brief, high-impact contact with students, as their stay in this country is under six months.  Our poster details the strategies we used in developing our program, and the impact we’ve seen as a result._
