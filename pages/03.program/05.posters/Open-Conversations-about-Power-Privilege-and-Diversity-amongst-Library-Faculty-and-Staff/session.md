_In Fall 2015 the Oviatt Library held a Town Hall and invited two of our faculty from the Social Work Department to facilitate a workshop on Power and Privilege. It was met with mixed reviews. Since that first Town Hall we have scheduled other events for library staff and faculty that examine the topics of power, privilege, diversity and inclusion. The purpose of these events have been to increase dialog, build alliances and foster positive, inclusive experiences between co-workers. In my poster presentation I will be examining the successes and failures of our programming and whether this has had a positive or negative impact on the organization's climate and culture. _
