_In 2014, the libraries at four Universities decided to collaborate and develop a multi-university residency program, called the Diversity Alliance.  The goal was to give each universityâ€™s resident(s) a broader educational experience, the opportunity to learn about the profession beyond their individual institution. With representation from each of the universities, this panel will discuss the why and how to create a similar program for any institution(s) considering forming a multi-university residency program._
