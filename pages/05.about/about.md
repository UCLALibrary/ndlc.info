The National Diversity in Libraries Conference (NDLC '16), co-sponsored by the UCLA Library and the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), will take place on the UCLA campus on August 10 - 13, 2016.

It also aims to articulate the value of and develop strategies for diversity and inclusion in LAMs in order to improve organizational excellence and community engagement.
