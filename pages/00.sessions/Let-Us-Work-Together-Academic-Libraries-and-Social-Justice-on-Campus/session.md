_A new wave of student activism reminds us that libraries are central to the lives of students as a place of study, socializing, rest, and engagement with conversations larger than themselves. In this workshop, we will share examples of libraries challenging and transcending a transactional model to forge solidarities with campus communities. Join us to discuss critical frameworks around ally-ship and solidarity, and to collectively develop strategies for engaging in transformative social justice work._
