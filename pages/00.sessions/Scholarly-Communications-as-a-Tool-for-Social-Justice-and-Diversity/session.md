_Countless studies and personal narratives have demonstrated that cultural, racial, and gender bias influence important aspects of academia, including in traditional book and journal publishing. Scholarly communications and LIS publishing can challenge the traditional modes of publishing both in format and content. Panelists will discuss their work in this area, addressing topics like race, culture, sexuality, and gender in formats like print books, online journals, and institutional repositories. _
