_The Latino Digital Archive Group (LDAG) was formed to explore the establishment of a Latino digital archive to 
digitally preserve all aspects of U.S. Latino history.  The Latino Digital Heritage Kit uses the Mukurtu CMS to 
engage communities in preserving their history through creating Latino digital collections. LDAG has two components:  1. facilitating heritage fairs that will provide learning opportunities and hands-on use of technology; 2. bringing together information professionals and representatives of state and national digital initiatives to lend their expertise by teaching concepts related to digital technology._
