_This strengths-based workshop will help participants develop inclusive spaces and diverse programming. Drawing on three case studies, NCSU librarians will share approaches for identifying and solving problems of access and representation. We will split into small groups to discuss participantsâ€™ campus and library climates, and workshop ideas to take back to their institutions. Participants will leave with strategies for creating sustainable and inclusive programming, spaces, and content for research libraries of all sizes. _
