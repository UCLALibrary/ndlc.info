_The University Libraries at UC Davis and UNLV will share four separate outreach efforts designed to contribute to a campus goal of diversity and inclusion. The presentation will emphasize the importance of the library as not only a connector of students and resources but also a pillar of support of engagement and inclusion. Each initiative reinforces the Libraryâ€™s role as the academic heart of the university and a place of community. This panel presentation will review each initiative, how each promoted student engagement and inclusion, and lessons learned._
