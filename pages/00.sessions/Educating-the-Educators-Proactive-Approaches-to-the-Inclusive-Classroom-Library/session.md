_As demographics and attention on our college campuses are finally shifting to reflect our increasingly diverse world, our classrooms must meet the needs and challenge the assumptions of both students and faculty from myriad experiences and backgrounds. This interactive and resource filled session will present approaches by 2 institutions that are working to foster proactive classroom approaches to inclusion. The Global Awareness Dialogue Project (GADP) at Penn State Abington is a faculty development initiative, aimed at increasing the collective cultural understanding and competence of the faculty while examining the changing dynamics in the classroom space. TILE: The Toolkit for Inclusive Learning Environments developed at John Hopkins University contains engaging pedagogically based classroom activities designed for faculty to help students interact more meaningfully in myriad areas of diversity, through their chosen discipline. By educating the educators, both projects present ways in which inclusivity can be thought of and integrated into the classroom in an intentional rather than reactive manner. Presenters will share with participants their accumulated resources and how they can partner with campus stakeholders to help create inclusive learning environments._
