_Digital content is ubiquitous, expanding information access in previously unimaginable ways. Powerful tools allow 
users to create and disseminate content in numerous formats, including complex documents, visually-intense 
presentations, and compelling multimedia. However, much of this content is inaccessible to people who have disabilities. Attend this session to see demonstrations of assistive technologies, to learn about Section 508 compliance, and to learn strategies and techniques to improve accessibility and inclusion for all users of our content. _
