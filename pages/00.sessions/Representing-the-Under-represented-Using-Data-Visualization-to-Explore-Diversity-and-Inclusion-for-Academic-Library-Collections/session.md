_Without institutional knowledge, or recent collections analysis, it is difficult to get purchase and perspective on how large research-intensive academic libraries address diversity and inclusion in their existing collections. Using Michigan State University Librariesâ€™ collections as an example, this presentation examines how data visualization furnishes pictorial, quantitative ways to discern trends, identify gaps and silences, and assess collection strengths in diversity and inclusion to help inform future collection development decisions._
