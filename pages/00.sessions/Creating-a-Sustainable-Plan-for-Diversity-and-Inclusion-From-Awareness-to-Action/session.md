_This panel presentation will describe how two University Libraries developed aspects of programming, training, and a
 plan to integrate diversity efforts into staffing and services. Phan and Carrillo will detail their Diversity Task 
 Force efforts and Mestre and Caragher will share the Blackboard Collaborate modules and workshop series for anti-oppression and microaggressions training that were developed. They each will describe methodologies used, findings, recommendations, specific actions, and suggestions for determining accountability. They will also share the lessons learned, and facilitate a discussion on challenges moving forward to help library faculty and staff develop competencies to promote diversity and inclusion in our workplaces, and to move beyond awareness to action.  _
